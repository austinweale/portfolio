Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
I feel like it makes sense to use firebase to store data or use the angular multipage architecture but not both. 
I chose to use multipage architecture to make each tab, and after that it didn't really seem like there was any place to use firebase stored data. So I decided to use firebase to store the tabs data and the state data.
